hi-score = -1
for all words in dictionary do:
  if current word cannot be formed out of letters on rack (and one letter on board), then
    skip it
  for all stored places on board to attach a word do:
    if current word won't fit (touches/overlaps other words on board), then
      skip this place on board
    calculate score
    if current score > hi-score then
      hi-score is set to current score
      hi-word is set to current word
      hi-loc is set to current place on board
finally, use hi-word/hi-loc for computer's turn
note: if hi-score = -1 (after all that), then no play is possible
